# QUICKSTART

Alias for linking to vk-dynamic is `vk::dynamic`

vk-dynamic is currently using version `1.3.260` of the vulkan headers.

gslang is bundled with the headers.

This does not change any of the normal includes you'd use for vulkan.

This fork is occasionally updated when new major versions of the vulkan headers are released.
