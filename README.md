# QUICKSTART

Alias for linking to vk-dynamic is `vk::dynamic`

vk-dynamic is currently using version `1.3.290` of the vulkan headers.
> Older versions of vk-dynamic are in dedicated branches

gslang is bundled with the headers and is using version `15.0.0`.

This does not change any of the normal includes you'd use for vulkan.

This fork is occasionally updated when new major versions of the vulkan headers are released.
